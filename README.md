# AtomApp

This app demonstrates a Bohr atomic model rendered with React Three Fiber. It uses Vite for bundling, Jotai for state, and MUI for UI components.

The interface adopts a holographic blue theme inspired by *Iron Man*. Users can tweak the number of orbits and electrons to instantly visualise different atomic structures with glowing particles.

## Features

- Adjust the number of orbits and electrons per orbit in real time.
- Control particle physics parameters such as gravity and speed.
- Export particle positions to JSON for further analysis.
- Experience a dark holographic theme with vibrant blue particles.
